## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```plaintext
api/
├── main.py                         # Entry point for the FastAPI application
├── config/                         # Configuration settings and environment management
├── alembic/                        # Database schema migrations
├── models/                         # Database table definitions
├── repositories/                   # Handles database interactions
├── services/                       # Encapsulates business logic
├── controllers/                    # Bridges HTTP requests with services
├── routes/                         # Defines API endpoints and organizes versioning
├── utils/                          # Shared utility functions

## Component Descriptions

1. **`main.py`**  
   The central entry point of the application that initializes the FastAPI app, configures middleware, registers routes, and starts the ASGI server. It ensures the application’s startup process is consistent and centralized.

2. **`config/`**  
   Manages application settings and environment variables. It centralizes configuration values like database connection strings, API keys, and other environment-specific settings to simplify maintenance and environment switching.

3. **`alembic/`**  
   Handles database schema migrations. It tracks and applies changes to the database schema over time, ensuring consistency across environments and supporting controlled schema upgrades and rollbacks.

4. **`models/`**  
   Defines database tables and relationships using SQLAlchemy. These models act as blueprints for the database schema and provide a programmatic interface for interacting with the data.

5. **`repositories/`**  
   Abstracts database interaction logic. Repositories handle querying, creating, updating, and deleting records while keeping data access logic separate and reusable.

6. **`services/`**  
   Encapsulates business logic, processes, validates, and orchestrates workflows between repositories and controllers. Services ensure a clean separation of concerns between data handling and request handling.

7. **`controllers/`**  
   Bridges HTTP-specific logic with services. Controllers process incoming requests, delegate tasks to the appropriate service, and format responses for the client.

8. **`routes/`**  
   Defines API endpoints and organizes them into logical groups. Versioning (e.g., `/api/v1`) is implemented to ensure backward compatibility and maintain clean and maintainable routing.

9. **`utils/`**  
   Contains shared helper functions and utility classes such as token management, password hashing, and response formatting. These utilities reduce code duplication and ensure consistency across the application.

10. **`middleware/`**  
    Processes global requests and responses, handling cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and request transformations. Middleware ensures consistent behavior across all routes.

11. **`__init__.py`**  
    Organizes Python packages by marking directories as modules. It simplifies imports by exposing only specific components of a module and modularizes the application structure.

## Vercel Deployment

### Purpose of `vercel.json`
The `vercel.json` file is used to configure the deployment settings for the application on **Vercel**. It defines routes, build settings, and other deployment-related configurations to ensure the application is correctly deployed and served on the Vercel platform.
